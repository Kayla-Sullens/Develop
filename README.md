## Description

For this assignment, we were given starter code to clone and then add to/finish certain things. Based on the acceptance criteria, I first created all of the Models that would be used. From there, I was able to create the various routes needed for each of the categories. After a lot of reserch, looking back at our class repo activities, and putting in a lot of work I felt ready to test things out. That's when I ran into a couple of small issues, but thankfully I was able to get some help with these and find my mistakes and fix them. After that, I was able to get things working in Insomnia. That was the biggest challenge I faced, since I have really struggled with Insomnia. I feel like this assignment really made me learn how to use it, and now I'm much more confident in my abilities.
